# PHP-OOP-AJAX-Calculator
This is a really simple web application calculator using Object Oriented PHP and AJAX.
It is also my first project on GitHub.

Functionality:
* Currently supports the 4 basic operations (add, subtract, multiply and divide)
* Supports floating numbers
* The result will be shown whether you click on '=' or another operator
* The result will be cleared at refresh

To-do:
* Implement the other basic operations
* Add a button to clear the result
* Change the ajax data type to JSON
